## My first blog

# Hi I'm Manodeep - An Aspiring ML Engineer

Welcome to my first blog post! My name is Manodeep, and I'm thrilled to embark on this journey of sharing my experiences, insights, and adventures as an aspiring Machine Learning (ML) engineer.

## Who Am I?

To kick things off, let me introduce myself. I'm a curious soul with a passion for all things tech and AI. Currently, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of Machine Learning and AI, exploring how these technologies can shape the future.

## My Journey So Far

I've been on an exciting path of learning and discovery. Here are a few highlights:

- **Education:** I'm a pre-final year student in KIIT university in Bhubaneshwar , India pursuing btech in Electornics and Computer Science

- **Experience:** 1. I'm currently doing a summer deep learning internship at IIT Bhilai, where I'm working on a cancer prediction web app. This project combines the power of image classification using YOLOv8n and symptom-based prediction using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model with Mistral 7B. 2. I am in the core ML team in USC.kiit society

## Why This Blog?
