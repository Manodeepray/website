# Building an Offline SMS LLM App for Buildspace: My Journey and Challenges

Hello everyone! It's Manodeep here again, back with another update on my exciting adventures in the world of Machine Learning and AI. Today, I want to share my ongoing project for Buildspace and some of the challenges I'm facing along the way.

## The Project: Offline SMS LLM App

Currently, I'm working on an offline SMS LLM (Large Language Model) app for Buildspace. The idea is to create an application that leverages the power of language models to provide intelligent responses via SMS, all while working offline. This project is both challenging and exhilarating, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with limited connectivity.

## Why an Offline SMS LLM App?

In many parts of the world, internet access is still a luxury. By developing an offline SMS LLM app, I aim to bring the benefits of AI to areas with limited or no internet connectivity. This app can help with various tasks, from educational assistance to quick information retrieval, all through simple SMS.

## The Journey So Far

### Initial Research and Planning

The journey began with extensive research. I needed to understand the limitations and possibilities of running a language model offline and how to integrate it with SMS functionality. This involved:

- **Selecting the Right Model:** Choosing a language model that can operate efficiently offline. Smaller, more efficient models like Mistral 7B came into consideration.
- **Understanding SMS Protocols:** Diving into the intricacies of SMS protocols and how to interact with them programmatically.

### Development Phase

With a solid plan in place, I started the development phase. Here's a snapshot of the process:

- **Model Optimization:** Ensuring the language model can run smoothly on devices with limited resources.
- **SMS Integration:** Developing the SMS interface to send and receive messages seamlessly.
- **User Interface:** Creating a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the app.

## The Progress

# Progess till 24.7.24

Now currently facing an issue of integrating the SMS interface . i have done everything but the number used by me is international number ..and my phone doesnt have international roaming :\..so i cant test my app ... so yeaaaa.
