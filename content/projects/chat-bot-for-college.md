## Chat Bot for College

Welcome to my chatbot project for the School of Electronics, KIIT University! This chatbot is designed to make information retrieval easier and more efficient for students and faculty.

### Features

- Built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for intelligent responses.

- Processes data in .csv, .pdf, and .txt formats collected from the official SOEE, KIIT website.

- Uses FAISS vector databases indexed with HuggingFace embeddings for efficient retrieval.

- Employs an Ensemble Retriever with weighted averaging and a History-Aware Retriever for seamless multi-turn conversations.

- Supports Gemini 1.5 Flash, HuggingFace models (serverless inference), and Ollama on-device models, providing flexibility in model selection.

- Interactive and user-friendly interface created with Streamlit for smooth interactions and queries.
